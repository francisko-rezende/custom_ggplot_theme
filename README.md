# custom_ggplot_theme
This is a clean-looking ggplot theme that I put together using a bunch of different sources. Unfortunately I can't remember them now, I'm sorry :disappointed_relieved:.

I do know that this was heavily inspired by some theme elements used by [Ricardo Solar](https://twitter.com/bob_solar) (might have even used parts of his code!) so he is definitely responsible for this theme's existence. The good parts that is, the probablematic stuff is my own doing.

I think this is suitable for scientific publications.
